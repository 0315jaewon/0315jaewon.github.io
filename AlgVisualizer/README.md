Current TODOs:
1. Complete edgeClickDetect() function
2. Implement edge weight adjustment feature in mousePressed() function under edge detection logic -> make sure to return once edge is adjusted
3. ^ Try a pop-up of this (i.e. takes in user input)?
4. Update edge weights in graph accordingly
5. Implement clickable nodes feature -> so we know where the algorithm starts
6. Also make nodes renamable?
7. Implement node names?
8. Implement edge and node remove feature when clicking on it


3. Clickable nodes
    - Clicking on a node lets you rename it or remove it
4. Clickable edges
    - clicking on an edge similarly lets you adjust its weight or remove it

Later steps:
- click on node to rename it?
- click on edge to
